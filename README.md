Enhanced Disk formatter for MS-DOS

## build_tools

The [build_tools](./build_tools) directory contains archives of tools needed to build the `master` branch 
from source. 4DOS is optional if you have MS-DOS/PC-DOS 6.0+. All of these archives are 
in the public domain, and downloaded either from [WinWorldPC](https://winworldpc.com/library), 
or the respective author's website.
